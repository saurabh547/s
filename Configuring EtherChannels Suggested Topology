Introduction 
EtherChannel is a port link aggregation technology in which multiple physical port links are grouped into 
one logical link. It is used to provide high-speed links and redundancy. A maximum of 8 links can be 
aggregated to form a single logical link.  
EtherChannel protocols – To form an EtherChannel, there are 2 protocols, port aggregation Protocol 
(PAgP) and link aggregation control protocol (LACP). 

1.LACP - Link Aggregation Control Protocol 
Link Aggregation Control Protocol is an IEEE protocol, originally defined in 802.3ad, used to form an 
EtherChannel. This protocol is almost similar to Cisco PAgP. There are different modes in which you can 
configure your interface. These are namely:   
1. ON: In this mode, the interface will be a part of EtherChannel but no negotiation takes place 
2. Active: In this mode, the interface will continuously attempt to convert the other side interface 
into an EtherChannel. 
3. Passive: In this mode, the interface will become a part of EtherChannel if and only if it is 
requested by the opposite interface. 
4. Off: No EtherChannel configured on the interface.

2. PAgP - Port Aggregation Protocol 
The Cisco proprietary protocol Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) is an EtherChannel technology. It’s a 
type of data/traffic load balancing that involves the logical aggregation of Cisco Ethernet switch ports. A 
PAgP EtherChannel can merge up to eight physical links into one virtual link. LACP, or Link Aggregation 
Control Protocol, is an IEEE open standard. These are namely:  
1. ON: In this mode, the interface will be a part of EtherChannel but no negotiation takes place. 
2. Desirable: In this mode, the interface will continuously attempt to convert the other side 
interface into an EtherChannel. 
3. Auto: In this mode, the interface will become a part of EtherChannel if and only if it is requested 
by the opposite interface. 
4. Off: No EtherChannel configured on the interface.
